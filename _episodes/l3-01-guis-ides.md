## Background

As with any aspect of your development environment, the choice of when to use a GUI
frontend to Git -- if at all -- is a matter of personal taste. Like text editors, there
are a plethora of options out there and people often have strong opinions about the
superiority of one over the other. In short, there's no single "right" way to do it.

Accordingly, this section, more so than previous ones, is really just an illustration of
*one* way to use Git with *one* particular GUI program; the hope is that you will gain
an understanding of the kinds of tasks that GUIs can make easier, so that you can make
your own decision about whether it's worth the hassle.

There are many GUI interfaces for Git to choose from; the Git website has [a decent
list](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis). For the purposes of this tutorial though, we
will stick to using [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) as it is free,
cross-platform and has (by our own subjective measure) one of the prettier and more
intuitive interfaces. Once you have completed this section, you may want to return to
the list of GUIs and see if there are any that better suit your own taste. Another good
choice is [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), GitHub's own attempt at
building a GUI: it is polished and well integrated with GitHub. (There's no Linux
client, however.) In addition, many IDEs and editors nowadays (including Visual Studio
Code and Sublime Text, etc.) have built-in integration with Git.

Whether you decide to use a GUI or not, however, we suggest it is important that you
also understand how to use Git from the command line: firstly, it teaches you about the
underlying concepts and, secondly, it is a useful fallback for when your shiny GUI falls
over.

## Why would I want to use a GUI?

Or: Surely all the cool kids just use Git from the command line?

While programs can convey a lot of information via a simple command-line interface,
there are limits to what can be conveyed easily. Notably, in the case of Git, your
repository's history is really a graph (specifically, a directed acyclic graph) and a
text interface isn't a particularly good way of showing a graph, as some of you may have
found when trying to understand the output of your `git graph` alias in the previous
section.

So far, your `recipe` repository is fairly simple, but it is worth noting that
repositories can become complex, e.g.:

![Example of a complex repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/gui_complex_repo.png "Example of a complex repository")

You wouldn't want to try to visualise this in your terminal, any more than you would a
Tube map.

(If you're wondering how a repository's history can end up looking so complicated, it's
because of a feature we aren't covering in this course in detail called branching. For
those who are interested, [it is covered in the intermediate-level Git
course][intermediate-branching].)

## Getting started with GitKraken

Firstly, you will need to download and install GitKraken, which can be obtained
[here](https://www.gitkraken.com/download).

Next you need to create a GitKraken account, the main purpose of which is to link the
GitKraken app with your GitHub account, so that you can make use of its GitHub
integration. While this is technically optional, we strongly recommend it. So, when you
start GitKraken, click "Sign up with GitHub":

![Sign up for GitKraken with GitHub account]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/gui_sign_up1.png "Sign up for GitKraken with GitHub account")

This should open a browser window in which you will have to sign in with GitHub. Once
this is complete GitKraken should log in automatically. If not, you may have to copy the
OAuth token manually into GitKraken (like I did).

Next, GitKraken will ask you to supply information about who you are, as you did when
you first started with Git. Enter your name and email address, then click "Create
Profile". Here's what it looks like for me:

![Creating a GitKraken profile]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/gui_sign_up2_create_profile.png "Creating a GitKraken profile")

You're now ready to roll!

## Examining your existing repository

Let's start by examining the `recipe` repository you've been working on. Open GitKraken
and click "File", then "Open Repo".

![Opening an existing repository in GitKraken]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/gui_open_repo1_menu.png "Opening an existing repository in GitKraken")

You should see something like the following:

![Viewing the recipe repository in GitKraken]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/gui_open_repo2_window.png "Viewing the recipe repository in GitKraken")

(If your window doesn't show all of these features, you may need to click on tabs etc.
to make them visible.)

For the most part, based on your understanding of Git, you should be able to understand
most of the features in this window, namely:

- In the middle of the screen you have your commit history
- On the left-hand side you can see your local `main` branch and the remote one too
  (note the GitHub logo to indicate that it's a remote)
- On the left-hand side, you also have a button to display your GitHub issues (I
  currently don't have any for this repository)
- On the right-hand side you have details about the current commit (the description,
  author, which files were changed etc.)

(Don't worry about the other buttons on the left-hand side for now. They aren't covered
in this course, but are in [the intermediate-level Git course][intermediate-course].)

Now click on "instructions.md" in GitKraken (under where it says "1 modified"). You
should now be able to see what changes were made to the file in the the last commit:

![Examining file modifications in GitKraken]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/gui_examine_changed_file.png "Examining file modifications in GitKraken")

Green lines indicate new text and red ones indicate removed text. In this case, as just
the "enjoy" instruction at the end of the file was removed, Git has interpreted this the
line being removed and replaced with an empty one.

Click the cross in the central pane to close this view and return to a view of the
repository's history.

## Modifying your repository

In this next section, you will make some more changes to your repository.

Return to your text editor/IDE and make the following changes:

- `ingredients.md`: Add "1 clove of garlic, chopped" to the list
- `instructions.md`: Change the instruction "and mix well" to "and mix thoroughly"

Now return to GitKraken and you should see that there is a yellow pencil icon with a "2"
next to it:

![Viewing modified files in GitKraken]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/gui_modifying1.png "Viewing modified files in GitKraken")

This indicates that two files have been modified since the last commit and that they are
not staged.

Click on this line with the yellow pencil and GitKraken will show you which files were
changed:

![Viewing unstaged changes in GitKraken]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/gui_modifying2_unstaged_changes.png "Viewing unstaged changes in GitKraken")

If you click on each of the files you can see how they were changed.

Note that there is a button to stage each file individually and one to stage them both
at once. If you accidentally stage a file, there is a corresponding "unstage" button for
individual files.

As we have made two changes that are essentially unrelated, let's make two separate
commits. Stage one of the files, add a commit message and click "Commit changes":

![Committing changes in GitKraken]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/gui_modifying3_commit_changes.png "Committing changes in GitKraken")

> ## Exercise: Add the other commit by yourself
>
> Stage the file, enter an appropriate message and commit it.
>
> GitKraken allows you to add a one-line summary as well as a longer description, so add
> one here. How does it appear when you view the commit with `git log`?

Now upload your changes to GitHub by pressing the "Push" button.

## Going further

> ## Exercise: Explore GitKraken yourself
>
> This final exercise is a change for you to play around and familiarise yourself with
> the interface. You could try repeating some of the tasks you completed previously
> using the command line (such as reverting a commit). There is a table below showing
> how you carry out these operations using GitKraken.
>
> You could also try creating a new repository on GitHub using GitKraken.
>
> There is also a useful series of tutorials [in the GitKraken user
> guide][gitkraken-guide].
